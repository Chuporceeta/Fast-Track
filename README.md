This web application provides a user-friendly interface for determining optimal routes between cities.
The website may be downloaded and run locally, or accessed at https://chuporceeta.github.io/Fast-Track.

In order to use our website the user needs to provide several parameters.
  1) The minimum city population, to control how many cities are displayed and available to pathfind between.
  2) Two city names, one for the starting location and one for the final destination.
  3) The next input allows the user to chose the amount of nearby cities that each city will have "roads" (edges) made to
  4) The next input is the maximum distance willing to travel between cities, to constrain all roads to a maximum length
  5) The last input is to select which shortest-path algorithm will be used.
